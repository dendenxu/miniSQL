# System Requirements

If you see any `Python` error about any package, use `pip` to fix the missing package. For example, if `QScintilla` is missing, you run `pip install QScintilla` from commandline.

Please make sure you have `Python` installed on your computer and these packages are required: `PyQt5, QDarkStyle, QScintilla, Pandas`.
Note that `Python` won't prompt you about `QScintilla` since it's a `PyQt5` extension, so make sure that is installed if you cannot import `Qsci` from `PyQt5`

# How to Run

To run miniSQL, you use python to execute the file `run.py` at root dir, which will by default load directories into `sys.path` and open a GUI.

If you prefer to use the old commandline version, you may navigate to `./code/` and execute `API.py` using python. And miniSQL will refuse to run since it's data files are all in the root folder.
The proper way to start the commandline is to:
1. open python interactive shell at root (by typing `ipython` in a terminal)
2. add `./code` to your python's path by typing in the following code:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append("code")
```
3. then you'll be able to `from API import main` and run `main`

If you prefer to do the "commandline thing" to the GUI, you should change `from API import main` to `from GUI import main`. It's not recommended to do so since `run.py` in the root folder does almost what I said above. Why typing so much?

# What to Execute

The miniSQL database is empty at first.
You can execute command specified in `./report/miniSQL.pdf` in miniSQL.

1. If you're using legacy commandline version, just type in the statement and hit `ENTER`. (Do remember to type in the semicolon: `;` when a statement ends.)
2. If you're using GUI, hit `Run` button at the upper right corner of the "little" window to run the command you've typed in the editor, where you'll find most editor shortcut is supported like `copy`, `delete line`...
Note that the keyboard shortcut for running the command should be `Ctrl + R` on Windows and `Command + R` on MacOS

If you don't know what to do about an empty database, you can execute `execfile testdata/student.txt` in miniSQL, which will take a while (about 40s with an SSD). When your mouse stops spinning and there's proper output in the output window, the file would be executed already.
Then you can execfile the TA's test file with: `execfile testdata/test.txt` which will show you some output. Or you can play around with supported commands.

# When to Quit

1. If you're in legacy commandline version, you can use `quit` or `exit` command in miniSQL to quit the miniSQL command prompt.
2. If you're using GUI, the same for CMD can be done. Also you can hit the `Quit` button to do your job. However, don't try to close the window by hitting `X` on the upper left/right corner, by which means the files might not be properly flushed to disk.
Note that on windows you can also hit `Ctrl + Q` to quit the GUI and save data properly. However don't use `Command + Q` on macOS since the system shortcut conflicts with it, which will seem like hitting the `X` directly, saving no data properly.
